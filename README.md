# MA999-assignmment-2021
Assessed work for MA999 Agent based modelling

The assignment is to pick an ABM that interests you, implement it using Agents.jl and produce a short recorded video in which you describe the model, demonstrate your implementation and discuss what can be concluded from the analysis of the results. 
You cannot select one of the ABMs that has already been implemented in the [Examples section of the Agents.jl documentation](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/examples/)

Here are some suggested links for inspiration:
